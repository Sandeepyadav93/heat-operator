# heat-operator
The Heat Operator deploys the OpenStack Heat project in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Description
This project should be used to deploy the OpenStack Heat project. It expects that there is an existing Database and Keystone service available to connect to. The config can be tuned using the `defaultConfigOverwrite` interface to override default config option in the `heat.conf` file.


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
// TODO(bshephar) - Write steps for testing on kind or CRC. Using kind will require that we don't use OpenShift specific CR's like Route.

### Uninstall CRDs
// TODO(bshephar)

### Undeploy controller
// TODO(bshephar)

## Contributing
// TODO(bshephar): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
// TODO(bshephar)

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
